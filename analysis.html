				The analysis retains four sections: house typology, street type, tourists and weather conditions, and detailed district analysis. The house typology is divided into four categories: a courtyard enclosed by one wall, a courtyard enclosed by two walls, a courtyard enclosed by three walls, and quadrangle courtyards. The courtyard enclosed by one wall is the main type of housing in Shuangwan. The streets includes two main types: single lane and two-way lane + sidewalk. As for the tourists and weather part, June and October are the peak tourist seasons, and May and September are the rainy seasons. The detailed district analysis includes vegetation analysis and demographic and occupational analysis.

						The design takes into account the design manner of rain gardens. Rain gardens, also called bioretention facilities, are one of a variety of practices designed to increase rain runoff reabsorption by the soil. They can also be used to treat polluted stormwater runoff. Rain gardens are designed landscape sites that reduce the flow rate, total quantity, and pollutant load of runoff from impervious urban areas like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas. Rain gardens rely on plants and natural or engineered soil medium to retain stormwater and increase the lag time of infiltration, while remediating and filtering pollutants carried by urban runoff. Rain gardens provide a method to reuse and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for additional irrigation.
